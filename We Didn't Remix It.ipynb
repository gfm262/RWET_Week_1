    "# We Didn't Start the Remix\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I took the lyrics from Billy Joel's \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" and remixed them using the [Dadaist Poem Code Example](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=119d55f57f4cae3eba15824655bb655564bc1a2a&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f61706172726973682f727765742f313139643535663537663463616533656261313538323436353562623635353536346263316132612f736f6d652d706f657472792d67656e657261746f72732e6970796e62&nwo=aparrish%2Frwet&path=some-poetry-generators.ipynb&repository_id=119094188&repository_type=Repository#To-Make-a-Dadaist-Poem) provided in the homework examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the song as the source for this project as I as [working with it for another class where we were making cut-up poetry for an assignment](https://www.martinsquared.com/2020/09/12/the-we-didnt-start-it-story-teller/) and I felt that it lent itself really well to remixing. \n",
    "\n",
    "I changed this up from the example given by including parameters to limited the maximum number of lines (max_lines=15) and changing the \"...\" at the end of the truncated verses with an exclamation mark (placeholder=\"!\"). I also added choruses between the verses and finished it off with the iconic ending line of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "I really enjoyed running this notebook a number of times. In addition to such gems as \"JFK, Sally Little Fortune\", Chubby Ole Ho crack\" and lines like this that seemed to group locations (though the order is random): \"Budapest, China, Pacific, shores, Around Elvis\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of coding, I'm starting to feel like all the hours and hours of coding practice and reading MDN Docs and searching through stackoverflow are starting to pay off. I was able to figure out how to get this notebook working how I envisioned it relatively easily. Ideally, I would have been able to remove any commas at the ends of verses (so you wouldn't have a \",!\"), but I figure that's something we'll learn to do this semester. You're welcome to copy this code to a notebook and try it yourself... the results just go on and on and on and on. (Sorry, I couldn't resist!)"
